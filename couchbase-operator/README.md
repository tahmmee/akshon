Deploying the Operator and Couchbase Server
===========================================

### REQUIRED
* [Helm 3.1+](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) is required when installing the couchbase cluster chart.
*  A license for Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.

### Quick Start
The Couchbase Operator can be used to instantly deploy the Autonomous Operator, Admission Controller, and Couchbase Cluster.
Additonally, Sync Gateway can be deployed, along with auto-generation of TLS and networking services.

To quickly deploy the admission controller and Operator, as well as a
Couchbase Server cluster:

1.  Add the chart repository to `helm`:
```console
helm repo add couchbase https://couchbase-partners.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
```
2.  Install the Chart:
```console
helm upgrade --install default couchbase/couchbase-operator
```
See Couchbase Helm [Documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/current/helm-setup-guide.html)
for more information about customizing and managing your charts.

| backuprestores | object | `{}` |  |
| backups | object | `{}` | CouchbaseBackups runs a job which preserves data into backups |
| buckets.default.compressionMode | string | `"passive"` | CompressionMode defines how Couchbase server handles document compression.  When off, documents are stored in memory, and transferred to the client uncompressed. When passive, documents are stored compressed in memory, and transferred to the client compressed when requested.  When active, documents are stored compresses in memory and when transferred to the client.  This field must be "off", "passive" or "active", defaulting to "passive".  Be aware "off" in YAML 1.2 is a boolean, so must be quoted as a string in configuration files. |
| buckets.default.conflictResolution | string | `"seqno"` | ConflictResolution defines how XDCR handles concurrent write conflicts. Sequence number based resolution selects the document with the highest sequence number as the most recent. Timestamp based resolution selects the document that was written to most recently as the most recent.  This field must be "seqno" (sequence based), or "lww" (timestamp based), defaulting to "seqno". |
| buckets.default.enableFlush | bool | `false` | EnableFlush defines whether a client can delete all documents in a bucket. This field defaults to false. |
| buckets.default.enableIndexReplica | bool | `false` | EnableIndexReplica defines whether indexes for this bucket are replicated. This field defaults to false. |
| buckets.default.evictionPolicy | string | `"valueOnly"` | EvictionPolicy controls how Couchbase handles memory exhaustion.  Value only eviction flushes documents to disk but maintains document metadata in memory in order to improve query performance.  Full eviction removes all data from memory after the document is flushed to disk.  This field must be "valueOnly" or "fullEviction", defaulting to "valueOnly". |
| buckets.default.ioPriority | string | `"low"` | IOPriority controls how many threads a bucket has, per pod, to process reads and writes. This field must be "low" or "high", defaulting to "low". Modification of this field will cause a temporary service disruption as threads are restarted. |
| buckets.default.kind | string | `"CouchbaseBucket"` | The type of the bucket to create by default. Removed from CRD as only used by Helm. |
| buckets.default.maxTTL | string | `nil` | MaxTTL defines how long a document is permitted to exist for, without modification, until it is automatically deleted.  This is a default and maximum time-to-live and may be set to a lower value by the client.  If the client specifies a higher value, then it is truncated to the maximum durability.  Documents are removed by Couchbase, after they have expired, when either accessed, the expiry pager is run, or the bucket is compacted. When set to 0, then documents are not expired by default.  This field must be a duration in the range 0-2147483648s, defaulting to 0.  More info: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration |
| buckets.default.memoryQuota | string | `"100Mi"` | MemoryQuota is a memory limit to the size of a bucket.  When this limit is exceeded, documents will be evicted from memory to disk as defined by the eviction policy.  The memory quota is defined per Couchbase pod running the data service.  This field defaults to, and must be greater than or equal to 100Mi.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources- containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes |
| buckets.default.minimumDurability | string | `nil` | MiniumumDurability defines how durable a document write is by default, and can be made more durable by the client.  This feature enables ACID transactions. When none, Couchbase server will respond when the document is in memory, it will become eventually consistent across the cluster. When majority, Couchbase server will respond when the document is replicated to at least half of the pods running the data service in the cluster.  When majorityAndPersistActive, Couchbase server will respond when the document is replicated to at least half of the pods running the data service in the cluster and the document has been persisted to disk on the document master pod.  When persistToMajority, Couchbase server will respond when the document is replicated and persisted to disk on at least half of the pods running the data service in the cluster.  This field must be either "none", "majority", "majorityAndPersistActive" or "persistToMajority", defaulting to "none". |
| buckets.default.name | string | `nil` | Name is the name of the bucket within Couchbase server.  By default the Operator will use the `metadata.name` field to define the bucket name. The `metadata.name` field only supports a subset of the supported character set.  When specified, this field overrides `metadata.name`. Legal bucket names have a maximum length of 100 characters and may be composed of any character from "a-z", "A-Z", "0-9" and "-_%\.". |
| buckets.default.replicas | int | `1` | Replicas defines how many copies of documents Couchbase server maintains.  This directly affects how fault tolerant a Couchbase cluster is.  With a single replica, the cluster can tolerate one data pod going down and still service requests without data loss.  The number of replicas also affect memory use.  With a single replica, the effective memory quota for documents is halved, with two replicas it is one third.  The number of replicas must be between 0 and 3, defaulting to 1. |
| cluster.antiAffinity | bool | `false` | AntiAffinity forces the Operator to schedule different Couchbase server pods on different Kubernetes nodes.  Anti-affinity reduces the likelihood of unrecoverable failure in the event of a node issue.  Use of anti-affinity is highly recommended for production clusters. |
| cluster.autoResourceAllocation | object | `{"cpuLimits":"4","cpuRequests":"2","enabled":false,"overheadPercent":25}` | AutoResourceAllocation populates pod resource requests based on the services running on that pod.  When enabled, this feature will calculate the memory request as the total of service allocations defined in `spec.cluster`, plus an overhead defined by `spec.autoResourceAllocation.overheadPercent`.Changing individual allocations for a service will cause a cluster upgrade as allocations are modified in the underlying pods.  This field also allows default pod CPU requests and limits to be applied. All resource allocations can be overridden by explcitly configuring them in the `spec.servers.resources` field. |
| cluster.autoResourceAllocation.cpuLimits | string | `"4"` | CPULimits automatically populates the CPU limits across all Couchbase server pods.  This field defaults to "4" CPUs.  Explicitly specifying the CPU limit for a particular server class will override this value.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources- containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes |
| cluster.autoResourceAllocation.cpuRequests | string | `"2"` | CPURequests automatically populates the CPU requests across all Couchbase server pods.  The default vaule of "2", is the minimum recommended number of CPUs required to run Couchbase Server.  Explicitly specifying the CPU request for a particular server class will override this value. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources- containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes |
| cluster.autoResourceAllocation.enabled | bool | `false` | Enabled defines whether auto-resource allocation is enabled. |
| cluster.autoResourceAllocation.overheadPercent | int | `25` | OverheadPercent defines the amount of memory above that required for individual services on a pod.  For Couchbase Server this should be approximately 25%. |
| cluster.autoscaleStabilizationPeriod | string | `nil` | AutoscaleStabilizationPeriod defines how long after a rebalance the corresponding HorizontalPodAutoscaler should remain in maintenance mode. During maintenance mode all autoscaling is disabled since every HorizontalPodAutoscaler associated with the cluster becomes inactive. Since certain metrics can be unpredictable when Couchbase is rebalancing or upgrading, setting a stabilization period helps to prevent scaling recommendations from the HorizontalPodAutoscaler for a provided period of time.   Values must be a valid Kubernetes duration of 0s or higher: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration A value of 0, puts the cluster in maintenance mode during rebalance but immediately exits this mode once the rebalance has completed. When undefined, the HPA is never put into maintenance mode during rebalance. |

| cluster.name | string | `nil` | Name of the cluster, defaults to name of chart release |
| cluster.networking.addressFamily | string | `nil` | DEVELOPER PREVIEW - this feature is not for production use. AddressFamily allows the manual selection of the address family to use. Couchbase server will default to "IPv4" regardless of underlying network configuration, so this must be manually set to enable use on an "IPv6" only network.  This field is immutable and cannot be changed once set. |
| cluster.networking.adminConsoleServiceTemplate | object | `{"metadata":{"annotations":null,"labels":null},"spec":{"clusterIP":null,"externalIPs":null,"externalName":null,"externalTrafficPolicy":null,"healthCheckNodePort":null,"ipFamily":null,"loadBalancerIP":null,"loadBalancerSourceRanges":null,"publishNotReadyAddresses":false,"selector":null,"sessionAffinity":null,"sessionAffinityConfig":{"clientIP":{"timeoutSeconds":null}},"topologyKeys":null,"type":"NodePort"}}` | AdminConsoleServiceTemplate provides a template used by the Operator to create and manage the admin console service.  This allows services to be annotated, the service type defined and any other options that Kubernetes provides.  When using a LoadBalancer service type, TLS and dynamic DNS must also be enabled. The Operator reserves the right to modify or replace any field.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes- api/v1.19/#service-v1-core |
| cluster.networking.adminConsoleServiceTemplate.metadata | object | `{"annotations":null,"labels":null}` | Standard objects metadata.  This is a curated version for use with Couchbase resource templates. |
| cluster.networking.adminConsoleServiceTemplate.spec | object | `{"clusterIP":null,"externalIPs":null,"externalName":null,"externalTrafficPolicy":null,"healthCheckNodePort":null,"ipFamily":null,"loadBalancerIP":null,"loadBalancerSourceRanges":null,"publishNotReadyAddresses":false,"selector":null,"sessionAffinity":null,"sessionAffinityConfig":{"clientIP":{"timeoutSeconds":null}},"topologyKeys":null,"type":"NodePort"}` | ServiceSpec describes the attributes that a user creates on a service. |
| cluster.networking.adminConsoleServices | list | `["data"]` | DEPRECATED - not required by Couchbase Server 6.5.0 onward. AdminConsoleServices is a selector to choose specific services to expose via the admin console. This field may contain any of "data", "index", "query", "search", "eventing" and "analytics".  Each service may only be included once. |

| cluster.networking.dns | object | `{"domain":null}` | DNS defines information required for Dynamic DNS support. |
| cluster.networking.dns.domain | string | `nil` | Domain is the domain to create pods in.  When populated the Operator will annotate the admin console and per-pod services with the key "external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname".  These annotations can be used directly by a Kubernetes External-DNS controller to replicate load balancer service IP addresses into a public DNS server. |
| cluster.networking.exposeAdminConsole | bool | `true` | ExposeAdminConsole creates a service referencing the admin console. The service is configured by the adminConsoleServiceTemplate field. |
| cluster.networking.exposedFeatureServiceTemplate | object | `{"metadata":{"annotations":null,"labels":null},"spec":{"clusterIP":null,"externalIPs":null,"externalName":null,"externalTrafficPolicy":null,"healthCheckNodePort":null,"ipFamily":null,"loadBalancerIP":null,"loadBalancerSourceRanges":null,"publishNotReadyAddresses":false,"selector":null,"sessionAffinity":null,"sessionAffinityConfig":{"clientIP":{"timeoutSeconds":null}},"topologyKeys":null,"type":"NodePort"}}` | ExposedFeatureServiceTemplate provides a template used by the Operator to create and manage per-pod services.  This allows services to be annotated, the service type defined and any other options that Kubernetes provides.  When using a LoadBalancer service type, TLS and dynamic DNS must also be enabled. The Operator reserves the right to modify or replace any field.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes- api/v1.19/#service-v1-core |
| cluster.networking.exposedFeatureServiceTemplate.metadata | object | `{"annotations":null,"labels":null}` | Standard objects metadata.  This is a curated version for use with Couchbase resource templates. |
| cluster.networking.exposedFeatureServiceTemplate.spec | object | `{"clusterIP":null,"externalIPs":null,"externalName":null,"externalTrafficPolicy":null,"healthCheckNodePort":null,"ipFamily":null,"loadBalancerIP":null,"loadBalancerSourceRanges":null,"publishNotReadyAddresses":false,"selector":null,"sessionAffinity":null,"sessionAffinityConfig":{"clientIP":{"timeoutSeconds":null}},"topologyKeys":null,"type":"NodePort"}` | ServiceSpec describes the attributes that a user creates on a service. |
| cluster.networking.exposedFeatureTrafficPolicy | string | `nil` | DEPRECATED  - by exposedFeatureServiceTemplate. ExposedFeatureTrafficPolicy defines how packets should be routed from a load balancer service to a Couchbase pod.  When local, traffic is routed directly to the pod.  When cluster, traffic is routed to any node, then forwarded on.  While cluster routing may be slower, there are some situations where it is required for connectivity.  This field must be either "Cluster" or "Local", defaulting to "Local", |
| cluster.networking.exposedFeatures | list | `["client","xdcr"]` | ExposedFeatures is a list of Couchbase features to expose when using a networking model that exposes the Couchbase cluster externally to Kubernetes.  This field also triggers the creation of per-pod services used by clients to connect to the Couchbase cluster.  When admin, only the administrator port is exposed, allowing remote administration.  When xdcr, only the services required for remote replication are exposed. The xdcr feature is only required when the cluster is the destrination of an XDCR replication.  When client, all services are exposed as required for client SDK operation. This field may contain any of "admin", "xdcr" and "client". Each feature may only be included once. |
| cluster.networking.loadBalancerSourceRanges | string | `nil` | DEPRECATED - by adminConsoleServiceTemplate and exposedFeatureServiceTemplate.

| cluster.platform | string | `nil` | Platform gives a hint as to what platform we are running on and how to configure services.  This field must be one of "aws", "gke" or "azure". |
| cluster.recoveryPolicy | string | `nil` | RecoveryPolicy controls how aggressive the Operator is when recovering cluster topology.  When PrioritizeDataIntegrity, the Operator will delegate failover exclusively to Couchbase server, relying on it to only allow recovery when safe to do so.  When PrioritizeUptime, the Operator will wait for a period after the expected auto-failover of the cluster, before forcefully failing-over the pods. This may cause data loss, and is only expected to be used on clusters with ephemeral data, where the loss of the pod means that the data is known to be unrecoverable. This field must be either "PrioritizeDataIntegrity" or "PrioritizeUptime", defaulting to "PrioritizeDataIntegrity". |
| cluster.rollingUpgrade | object | `{"maxUpgradable":null,"maxUpgradablePercent":null}` | When `spec.upgradeStrategy` is set to `RollingUpgrade` it will, by default, upgrade one pod at a time.  If this field is specified then that number can be increased. |
| cluster.rollingUpgrade.maxUpgradable | string | `nil` | MaxUpgradable allows the number of pods affected by an upgrade at any one time to be increased.  By default a rolling upgrade will upgrade one pod at a time.  This field allows that limit to be removed. This field must be greater than zero. The smallest of `maxUpgradable` and `maxUpgradablePercent` takes precedence if both are defined. |
| cluster.rollingUpgrade.maxUpgradablePercent | string | `nil` | MaxUpgradablePercent allows the number of pods affected by an upgrade at any one time to be increased.  By default a rolling upgrade will upgrade one pod at a time.  This field allows that limit to be removed. This field must be an integer percentage, e.g. "10%", in the range 1% to 100%. Percentages are relative to the total cluster size, and rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a minimum of 1.  For example, a 10 pod cluster, and 25% allowed to upgrade, would yield 2.5 pods per iteration, rounded down to 2. The smallest of `maxUpgradable` and `maxUpgradablePercent` takes precedence if both are defined. |
| cluster.security.adminSecret | string | `""` | AdminSecret is the name of a Kubernetes secret to use for administrator authentication. The admin secret must contain the keys "username" and "password".  The password data must be at least 6 characters in length, and not contain the any of the characters `()<>,;:\"/[]?={}`. |

| cluster.security.username | string | `"Administrator"` | Cluster administrator username |
| cluster.securityContext.fsGroup | int | `1000` | A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod. Some volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume to be owned by the pod:   1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup 2. The setgid bit is set (new files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup) 3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----   If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume. |
| cluster.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy | string | `nil` | fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of the volume before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions). It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps and emptydir. Valid values are "OnRootMismatch" and "Always". If not specified defaults to "Always". |
| cluster.securityContext.runAsGroup | string | `nil` | The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default if unset. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. |
| cluster.securityContext.runAsNonRoot | bool | `true` | Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. |
| cluster.securityContext.runAsUser | int | `1000` | The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. |

If unspecified, the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each container.  May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. |
| cluster.securityContext.seLinuxOptions.level | string | `nil` | Level is SELinux level label that applies to the container. |
| cluster.securityContext.seLinuxOptions.role | string | `nil` | Role is a SELinux role label that applies to the container. |

| cluster.securityContext.seccompProfile.type | string | `nil` | type indicates which kind of seccomp profile will be applied. Valid options are:   Localhost - a profile defined in a file on the node should be used. RuntimeDefault - the container runtime default profile should be used. Unconfined - no profile should be applied. |
| cluster.securityContext.supplementalGroups | string | `nil` | A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in addition to the container's primary GID.  If unspecified, no groups will be added to any container. |
| cluster.securityContext.sysctls | list | `[]` | Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with unsupported sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch. |
| cluster.securityContext.windowsOptions | object | `{"gmsaCredentialSpec":null,"gmsaCredentialSpecName":null,"runAsUserName":null}` | The Windows specific settings applied to all containers. If unspecified, the options within a container's SecurityContext will be used. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. |

| cluster.securityContext.windowsOptions.runAsUserName | string | `nil` | The UserName in Windows to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to the user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. |
| cluster.serverGroups | string | `nil` | ServerGroups define the set of availability zones you want to distribute pods over, and construct Couchbase server groups for.  By default, most cloud providers will label nodes with the key "failure- domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone", the values associated with that key are used here to provide explicit scheduling by the Operator.  You may manually label nodes using the "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone" key, to provide failure-domain aware scheduling when none is provided for you. Global server groups are applied to all server classes, and may be overridden on a per-server class basis to give more control over scheduling and server groups. |
| cluster.servers.default.autoscaleEnabled | bool | `false` | AutoscaledEnabled defines whether the autoscaling feature is enabled for this class.
